Q1
Find the titles of all movies directed by Steven Spielberg. 
SELECT title FROM Movie WHERE director = "Steven Spielberg";

Q2
Find all years that have a movie that received a rating of 4 or 5, and sort them in increasing order.
SELECT DISTINCT year From Movie LEFT JOIN Rating 
ON Movie.mID = Rating.mID 
WHERE Stars >= 4
ORDER BY Year ASC;

Q3
Find the titles of all movies that have no ratings.  
SELECT title FROM Movie LEFT JOIN Rating
ON Movie.mID = Rating.mID
WHERE Stars IS NULL;

Q4
Some reviewers didn't provide a date with their rating. Find the names of all reviewers who have ratings with a NULL value for the date. 
SELECT name FROM Reviewer LEFT JOIN Rating
ON Reviewer.rID = Rating.rID
WHERE ratingDate IS NULL;

Q5
Write a query to return the ratings data in a more readable format: reviewer name, movie title, stars, and ratingDate. Also, sort the data, first by reviewer name, then by movie title, and lastly by number of stars. 
SELECT name, title, stars, ratingDate From Reviewer 
LEFT JOIN Rating 
ON Reviewer.rID = Rating.rID
LEFT JOIN Movie
ON Rating.mID = Movie.mID
ORDER BY name, title, stars ASC;

Q7
For each movie that has at least one rating, find the highest number of stars that movie received. Return the movie title and number of stars. Sort by movie title. 
SELECT title, max(stars) FROM Movie
LEFT JOIN Rating
ON Movie.mID = Rating.mID
WHERE stars NOT NULL
GROUP BY title
ORDER BY title;

Q8
For each movie, return the title and the 'rating spread', that is, the difference between highest and lowest ratings given to that movie. Sort by rating spread from highest to lowest, then by movie title. 
SELECT title, max(stars)-min(stars) as spread FROM Movie
LEFT JOIN Rating
ON Movie.mID = Rating.mID
WHERE stars NOT NULL
GROUP BY title
ORDER BY spread DESC, title ASC;

Q9
Find the difference between the average rating of movies released before 1980 and the average rating of movies released after 1980. (Make sure to calculate the average rating for each movie, then the average of those averages for movies before 1980 and movies after. Don't just calculate the overall average rating before and after 1980.)
